<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Erin! So, what&rsquo;s my story?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="professional-career-">Professional Career</h3>
<p>A little bit about how I stumbled into the web and software development world:</p>
<p>I graduated with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Sociology from Austin Peay State University in December of 2013, with minors in Psychology and Health, but had not a clue what I wanted to pursue as a career.
I worked at a local English as a Second Language school as the Media and Technology Coordinator/Administrative Assistant for almost two years.</p>
<p>After working there for over a year, I was looking at the school&rsquo;s website one day and thought to myself,
&ldquo;Hmm, this website is a bit outdated, difficult to navigate, and not mobile responsive. How can I improve these aspects of the site?&rdquo;
I did a quick Google search which led me down a rabbit hole of learning to code websites. So I started dabbling in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own via these various online resources, and began attending technology related meetups in the Nashville area.</p>
<p>I started with the
<a href="https://nashvillewomenprogrammers.com/" target="_blank">Nashville Women Programmers Meetup</a>,
where I met many people who were either current or former students of the
<a href="https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" target="_blank">Nashville Software School</a> (NSS).
I enrolled in an intensive 4 week Intro to Web Development course with
<a href="https://savvycoders.com/" target="_blank">Savvy Coders</a>
in the fall of 2015, and began the 6 month full time software development program at NSS in January of 2016.
Many of the skills I learned there and the projects I worked on can be found on my
<a href="https://github.com/eorstrom" target="_blank">Github profile</a>.</p>
<p>I started my first developer role as a Complex Application Developer with the Strategic Technology Solutions department with the State of Tennessee as a contractor at the end of August 2016.<br>
I later worked at InfoWorks on a four month contract from June 2017 until October 2017 working on a tax document generator application.</p>
<p>In January 2018, I joined a company called
<a href="https://www.navihealth.com/" target="_blank">naviHealth</a>. I started in a hybrid position of part Software Engineer and part Business Analyst for the product support tier 3 development team. Over the first 6 months or so, I began taking on more Product Owner responsibilities, and as of August 2020, I am the Product Owner for the Integrations team.</p>
<p>As of October 2020, I have over 4 years of professional experience.
You can read in more detail about my professional roles and experience on my
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinorstrom/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.
(Or ask me about it!)</p>
<h3 id="professional-interests-">Professional Interests</h3>
<p>In terms of professional interests, I have a wide variety, and haven&rsquo;t found any one thing that drives my passion. But I am driven to do my best in whatever I do and always continue to learn new things, both professionally and on my own time.</p>
<p>I have a general interest in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education and e-learning</li>
<li>Productivity and collaborative tools</li>
<li>Health/fitness applications</li>
<li>Travel and hospitality</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="podcasting-">Podcasting</h3>
<p>In November of 2016, I was a guest for the first time on the
<a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Complete Developer Podcast</a>,
a local Nashville podcast hosted by a couple of friends,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamwgant/" target="_blank">Will Gant</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj-burns/" target="_blank">BJ (Beej) Burns</a>.
The topic was a round table discussion on
<a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-64/" target="_blank">Ways to Learn Code</a>,
in which Beej, Will, and I discussed each of our different paths in learning software development (Self-taught, 4 year Computer Science degree, and Bootcamp, respectively).
Give it a listen, and if you like the episode, be sure to check out some of their other episodes.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been a guest on three additional episodes of the Complete Developer Podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-93/" target="_blank">Continual Learning with Erin Orstrom</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-108/" target="_blank">Effective Communication</a>,</li>
<li>and the episode where we announced the launch of a podcast in which I was previously a cohost -
<a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-107/" target="_blank">Junior Developer Toolbox</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Junior Developer Toolbox</i> was a podcast all about getting started in and surviving a career in software engineering which I co-hosted with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveharned/" target="_blank">Dave Harned</a> from September 2017 until April 2019, and we released a total of 40 episodes.
We dove deep into issues affecting new and junior-level programmers in the workplace and beyond and shared our experiences and knowledge in hopes of helping others find their way and break into the software development field.</p>
<h3 id="everything-else-">Everything Else</h3>
<p>I have recently discovered an interest in painting during the coronavirus pandemic. I&rsquo;ve mostly been working with watercolors, but have also experimented with gouache and acrylic. You can see my work in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10157185697577038&type=3" target="_blank">this Facebook album</a> and also shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eeyorestrom/?hl=en" target="_blank">my Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>I also enjoy playing video games, reading, watching shows and movies on all the various streaming services, and walking around my neighborhood, swimming, and yoga for exercise. Pre-pandemic I enjoyed exploring new restaurants in search of tasty food and traveling to new places. My most recent trip was to Universal Studios with my sister in March (right before everything shut down), and I went to Belize in November 2019.</p>
