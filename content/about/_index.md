Hi, I'm Erin!  
So, what's my story?

#### Professional Career ####

A little bit about how I stumbled into the web and software development world:

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from Austin Peay State University in December of 2013, with minors in Psychology and Health,
but had not a clue what I wanted to pursue as a career.
I ended up working at a local English as a Second Language school as the
Media and Technology Coordinator/Administrative Assistant for two years after finishing college.

After working there for over a year, I was looking at the school's website one day and thought to myself,
"Hmm, this website is a little outdated, difficult to navigate, and not mobile responsive. How can I improve these aspects of the site?"
I then started dabbling in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my own via various online resources, and began attending technology related Meetups in the Nashville area.

I started with the
<a href="https://nashvillewomenprogrammers.com/" target="_blank">Nashville Women Programmers Meetup</a>,
where I met many people who were either current or former students of the
<a href="https://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/" target="_blank">Nashville Software School</a> (NSS).
I enrolled in an intensive 4 week Intro to Web Development course with
<a href="https://savvycoders.com/" target="_blank">Savvy Coders</a>
in the fall of 2015, and began the 6 month full time software development program at NSS in January of 2016.
Many of the skills I learned there and the projects I worked on can be found below and on my
<a href="https://github.com/eorstrom" target="_blank">Github profile</a>.

I started my first developer role as a Complex Application Developer with the Strategic Technology Solutions department with the
State of Tennessee as a contractor at the end of August 2016.  
I worked at InfoWorks on a four month contract from June 2017 until October 2017 working on a tax document generator application.
Currently, I'm at a company called
<a href="https://www.navihealth.com/" target="_blank">naviHealth</a> in a hybrid position of part software engineer, part product owner, and part business analyst
for the product support tier 3 development team.

As of March 2020, I have over 3 years of professional experience.

#### Podcasting ####

In November of 2016, I was a guest for the first time on the
<a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Complete Developer Podcast</a>,
a local Nashville podcast hosted by a couple of friends,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamwgant/" target="_blank">Will</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj-burns/" target="_blank">Beej</a>.
The topic was a round table discussion on
<a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-64/" target="_blank">Ways to Learn Code</a>,
in which Beej, Will, and I discussed each of our different paths in becoming developers.
Give it a listen below, and if you like the episode, be sure to check out some of their other episodes.

Since then, I have been a guest on three additional episodes of the Complete Developer Podcast:

* <a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-93/" target="_blank">Continual Learning with Erin Orstrom</a>,  
* <a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-108/" target="_blank">Effective Communication</a>,  
* and the episode where we announced the launch of a podcast in which I was previously a cohost -
<a href="https://completedeveloperpodcast.com/episode-107/" target="_blank">Junior Developer Toolbox</a>.

<a href="https://juniordevelopertoolbox.com/" target="_blank">Junior Developer Toolbox</a>
was a podcast all about getting started in and surviving a career in software engineering which I co-hosted with my friend
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveharned/" target="_blank">Dave Harned</a>
from September 2017 until April 2019.
We dove deep into issues affecting new and junior-level programmers in the workplace and beyond and shared our experiences and knowledge in hopes of
helping others find their way and break into the software development field.
