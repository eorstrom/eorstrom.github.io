      <description>A volunteer project I am currently involved with, working with web developers to update the design of the Nashville Film Festival website to better align with their brand and mission, in addition to updating the site security.
We meet once a week for progress updates. We have secured the new design approval based on wireframes the team created. We are currently at the beginning of the implementation stage of the redesign.</description>

      <description>Junior Developer Toolbox was a podcast about building, maintaining, and surviving a career in software engineering. We provided real talk from the trenches about everyday life as a junior developer.
The podcast was co-hosted by my friend Dave Harnedand myself, and early on by Jason Belcher. We produced 40 episodes over 18 months on a biweekly basis on various topics related to software development and our experience working in the industry as junior software developers.</description>
